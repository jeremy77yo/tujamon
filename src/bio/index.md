jeremy or tu jamon works across collage and sound, suturing physical and digital media into unstable narratives. under Twin G, a collaborative project based in San Francisco, ambient-adjacent compositions emerge from scraps of daily noise—fragile, flickering songs shaped by repetition and decay.

the visual work draws from browsed artifacts, shredded photographs, discarded matter, and scans layered until the boundary between physical and digital dissolves.

the practice asks: how does everyday noise become a map of feeling? what can loss, error, and degradation make possible?
